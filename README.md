# Calculation Pi number using Monte Carlo algorithm

This repository is aimed to be collection of implementations of a simple Monte Carlo algorithm for computing Pi number.

## Benchmark

All measurements were made with using [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on laptop Intel i3-5005U, 2.00 GHz.

`Number of iterations = 1_000_000_000`

All benchmarks made with different random engines. It's more comparison of implementations of random generators with different algorithms than comparison of speed of languages itself. However, it`s also interesting, because it looks more like real life case.

\* -- Odin output 3.141 (only 3 digits after point). It seems that this language still doesn't have full support of float64 type. Required test after next release

\*\* -- very different result in Linux and in Windows
